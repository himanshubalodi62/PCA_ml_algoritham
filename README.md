# PCA_ml_algoritham
# The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the process of computing principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data.
+ The Principal Component of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of p unit vectors, where the i-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the i - 1 vectors. The best-fitting line is defined as the line that minimizes the average squared distance from the points to the line.
+ PCA is commonly used in dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible.
